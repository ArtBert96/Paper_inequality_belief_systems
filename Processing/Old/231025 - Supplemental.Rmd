In this file we report additional analyses for the paper "Inequality belief systems: what they look like, how
to study them, and why they matter". We report a list of tables and figures at the beginning of the file, and we plot them in order at the end of this summary. 

# Table of contents
* **Descriptives:** The master table shows the label and the survey question of each attitude reported in the analyses. Table 2 and Table 3 show the descriptives of these items in US and NL respectively. High values always indicate endorsement of each attitude.

* **Standardized EGA Plot:** To facilitate the direct comparison of the 4 belief systems, we report a standardized plot. In Figure 1, the layout of the networks is kept constant across the US and NL networks. 

* **Cronbach's alpha:** Table 4 reports the reliability of the indexes 1, 2 and 3, adopted in the regression models of Section 4.4 (Table 2: Linear regression models on support for redistribution - US; Table 3: Linear regression models on support for redistribution - NL). Indexes 1 and Indexes 2 are reliable across countries. Indexes 3 display low alphas instead. This is not surprising, as this indexes feature the node b_merit. As described in the article, this node produce several changes between belief system of the NL and US population. Therefore, these low scores underline that full sample analysis might be misleading if not taking into account the structural heterogeneity of survey samples. We decided to work with these variables, despite their low reliability, as indexes were computed only to reduce data to fit the regression models of Section 4.4, which needed to account for the content of people's belief systems.  

* **Robustness of EGA:** To detect the robustness of EGA results we adopt parametric bootstrap technique. For each network shown in the article, we reseample with replacement 2000 bootstrapped samples. Then, we re-estimate EGA on each of the 2000 bootstrapped samples. This allow us to compare the results of the EGA fitted on the original sample with the average results of obtained in the bootstrapped samples. Moreover, we are also able to estimate the stability of the community detection algorithm, by examining the extent to which each empirically derived dimension is exactly recovered from the replicate bootstrap samples. In the article we estimated six network structures: one for each CCA cluster (two in US, two in NL) and one for each country. For each of these six network we report two figures. First, we compare the network structures retrieved in the original samples with the average structures obtained by aggregating the results of the bootstrapped samples. Effectively, this results in a figure comparing the original networks shown in the article and the average network obtained in the bootstrapped samples. Moreover, we report a plot showing how often the membership of each variable is replicating across bootstraps. Regarding this plot, item scores greater than 0.70 reflect sufficient stability [(Christensen & Golino, 2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-8611/3/3/32). 
Results are shown in Figures 2 to Figures 13. Overall, the sample and bootstrapped EGAs are always similar, and community detection results are robust and overcome the bootstrap robustness tests. The only exceptions to these patterns are the nodes ib_people, and ib_weafam in the US2 network, and the node b_merit in the US1 and US2 networks. These nodes change their community membership across bootstrapped samples. However, the results regarding the number of communities of US1 EGA is highly stable. Indeed, 1946 of the 2000 bootstrapped samples displayed 3 clusters; only 1 bootstrapped sample displayed 2 clusters, and only 53 samples produced 4 communities. Moreover, the edges of the sample and bootstrapped networks do not differ meaningfully. This entails that the instability of this network is due to the community membership of some of its node, and not to its edges. Since our analyses of the four belief system mainly focused on the latter, and utilized nodes' community membership as a descriptive tool, we are not concerned with this kind of instability. Instability at the community membership level would be a concern only for the full sample networks. Indeed, these communities dictated the formation of the indexes for the regressions of Section 4.4. However, these results are remarkably stable (item stability always higher than .74 in NL, and higher than .96 in US).
